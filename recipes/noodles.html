    <p>
      This incredible Asian-style noodle dish features a very unusual
      combination of pumpkin and Korean chile paste that makes for one of the

      recipe for fall, but really, can be enjoyed any time of the year.

      <p>
        Heat oil in a skillet over medium high heat and cook pork, while
        breaking up into small pieces, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt, pepper,
        and smoked paprika and keep cooking and stirring until pork is crumble

        Lower heat to medium and add garlic and green onions. Cook for 30
        seconds until fragrant. Mix in hoisin sauce and cook until sauce has
        glazed over all the pork pieces, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer pork topping
        to a bowl.

        Pour out cooking grease but leave 1 tablespoon of grease in the skillet.
        Add pumpkin puree, gochujang, green onions, sesame oil, and chili
        peppers. Cook and stir over medium heat for 2 minutes.

        Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook
        bucatini the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm
        to the bite, about 10 minutes. Fish out noodles and drop into the
        skillet with the pumpkin sauce. Reserve about 1/2 cup pasta cooking
        water.
      </p>
      <li>Step 6</li>

        Squeeze lime juice on top of the noodles. Add about 2 tablespoons pasta
        water on top and mix noodles with the sauce until well combined. Keep
        adding pasta water, a little at a time, until sauce has reached your
        preferred consistency.
      </p>

        Turn off heat and stir in chopped cilantro. Transfer noodles to a plate
        and top with ground pork.
